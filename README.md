## How to Compile the Code:
To compile the code, go to the directory and type ```python3 TopTenCounter.py file.txt``` or ```python3 TopTenManuel.py file.txt``` where ```file.txt``` is any file in the directory. 

## Descriptions and Test Examples:
```TopTenCounter.py``` displays the top 10 common words through a dictionary without accounting for ties. It is coded using the counter class from the collections module. Most of the code is inspired from this site: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-k-frequent-words-data-set-python/
